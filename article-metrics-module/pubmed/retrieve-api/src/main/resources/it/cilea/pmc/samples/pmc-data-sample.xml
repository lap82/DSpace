					<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic hepatitis.
						The virus does not replicate efficiently in cell cultures, and it
						is therefore difficult to assess infection-neutralizing antibodies
						and to evaluate protective immunity in vitro. To study the binding
						of the HCV envelope to cell-surface receptors, we developed an
						assay to assess specific binding of recombinant envelope proteins
						to human cells and neutralization thereof. HCV recombinant
						envelope proteins expressed in various systems were incubated with
						human cells, and binding was assessed by flow cytometry using
						anti-envelope antibodies. Envelope glycoprotein 2 (E2) expressed
						in mammalian cells, but not in yeast or insect cells, binds human
						cells with high affinity (Kd approximately 10(-8) M). We then
						assessed antibodies able to neutralize E2 binding in the sera of
						both vaccinated and carrier chimpanzees, as well as in the sera of
						humans infected with various HCV genotypes. Vaccination with
						recombinant envelope proteins expressed in mammalian cells
						elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies that correlated
						with protection from HCV challenge. HCV infection does not elicit
						neutralizing antibodies in most chimpanzees and humans, although
						low titers of neutralizing antibodies were detectable in a
						minority of infections. The ability to neutralize binding of E2
						derived from the HCV-1 genotype was equally distributed among sera
						from patients infected with HCV genotypes 1, 2, and 3,
						demonstrating that binding of E2 is partly independent of E2
						hypervariable regions. However, a mouse monoclonal antibody raised
						against the E2 hypervariable region 1 can partially neutralize
						binding of E2, indicating that at least two neutralizing epitopes,
						one of which is hypervariable, should exist on the E2 protein. The
						neutralization-of-binding assay described will be useful to study
						protective immunity to HCV infection and for vaccine development.</p>
